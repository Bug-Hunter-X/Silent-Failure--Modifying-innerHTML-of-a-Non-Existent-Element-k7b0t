This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic bug in HTML JavaScript interaction.  The bug involves attempting to access and modify the `innerHTML` property of an element that does not exist in the DOM. This can lead to unexpected behavior where the code runs without throwing an error, but the intended changes aren't applied. The solution shows how to correctly handle this scenario using error handling.
